Reporting Bugs and Asking Questions
------------------------------------

Questions, bug reports and feature requests are happily accepted via the
`GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/jantman/awslimitchecker/issues>`_.
Pull requests are welcome. Issues that don't have an accompanying pull request
will be worked on as my time and priority allows, but I'll do my best to
complete feature requests as quickly as possible. Please take into account that
I work on this project solely in my personal time, I don't get paid to work on it
and I can't work on it for my day job, so there may be some delay in getting
things implemented.

I can often be found on `freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ as "jantman".
