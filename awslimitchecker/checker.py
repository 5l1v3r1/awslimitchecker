        Set manual overrides on AWS service limits, i.e. if you

        :py:meth:`~._AwsService.set_limit_override` on the corresponding
        _AwsService instance.

        Explicitly set limit overrides using this method will take
        precedence over default limits. They will also take precedence over
        limit information obtained via Trusted Advisor, unless ``override_ta``
